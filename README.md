# UT Austin Fundraising Analysis
In this project, I am asking the question: who is more likely to donate money to a cause?
I want to address the most efective way to utilize resources with the goal being no time lost on individuals who don't want to donate money. I want to give managers a tool that will group likely donors into a category and then give that information to my direct reports to focus their efforts and achieve a success rate of over 95% within an 8 hour period. 
## Overview of the Analysis Scope of the Project
I am using a dataset from Kaggle that redacted names, emails, and phone numbers but contains 14 columns with information ranging from age to education level to marital status and income. This data is presented in both text and integer format. I am demonstrating my knowledge of unsupervised machine learning algorithiums
